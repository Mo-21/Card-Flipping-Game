## Card Flipping Game

This is a memory card game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and classes. The game involves flipping cards to find matching pairs until all cards are matched.

## Features

- Card Flipping: Click on cards to flip them.
- Matching Pairs: Find matching pairs by remembering card positions.
- Game Logic: Built with OOP principles and classes for maintainability and scalability.

## Code Structure

The codebase follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach using JavaScript classes:

- Game Board Class: Manages the game state, including card positions, flipping logic, and winning conditions.
- Sound Class: Manages the game audio, and triggers the right audio sample.

The code is organized and structured to separate concerns, making it easy to understand, scale and extend.
